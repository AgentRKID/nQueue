## nQueue

## Archived
This plugin has been archived, i created this as an open source plugin but i lost motivation after uploading it and having other things to work on, its code is alright, not the best alot of things could be cleaned up, and it could most definally use a better redis system.

### Info

nQueue is a open sourced multi-proxy queue system allowing servers to have hubs on hubs without the issue of unordered queues

### Features
* Multiple Proxies support
* Multiple Hub suuport
* Queue Decaying
* As many queues as you want
* Independent & Bukkit only (Because of [Rabbit](https://github.com/AgentRKID/Rabbit/))

### Compiling
As most people won't have paper downloaded, you must download it or CraftBukkit to use it, or even use your own spigot.
```xml
mvn package
```

### Current State
This is usuable but there is no priority support or even an API to interact with, be patient as this will role out soon.

### Usage
If you use this/fork it please all i ask for is credit, if you're using it on your network and having trouble message me on discord @ rkid#0001

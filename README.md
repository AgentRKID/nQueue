## nQueue
nQueue is a open sourced multi-proxy queue system allowing servers to have hubs on hubs without the issue of unordered queues

### Features
* Multiple Proxies support
* Multiple Hub suuport
* Queue Decaying
* As many queues as you want
* Independent & Bukkit only (Because of [Rabbit](https://github.com/AgentRKID/Rabbit/))

### Compiling
As most people won't have paper downloaded, you must download it or CraftBukkit to use it, or even use your own spigot.
```xml
mvn package
```

### Current State
This is usuable but there is no priority support or even an API to interact with, be patient as this will role out soon.

### Usage
If you use this/fork it please all i ask for is credit, if you're using it on your network and having trouble message me on discord @ rkid#0001
